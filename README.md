The Drowsiness Detection System monitors a person's alertness using a webcam by analyzing facial features, specifically the eyes and mouth. It detects drowsiness through the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and yawning by measuring lip distance. When fatigue is detected, the system triggers an alarm to alert the user, helping prevent accidents. 
The primary goal of the code is to detect signs of drowsiness in real-time using the webcam and notify the user by playing an alarm sound. The two key indicators of drowsiness the system checks for are:
Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR): A metric to detect blinking and closed eyes. If the eyes remain closed for an extended period, it suggests the person may be falling asleep.
Lip Distance: This measures the distance between the upper and lower lips to detect yawning, which is another common indicator of tiredness.
