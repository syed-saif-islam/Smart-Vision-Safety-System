The Drowsiness Detection System monitors a person's alertness using a webcam by analyzing facial features, specifically the eyes and mouth. It detects drowsiness through the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and yawning by measuring lip distance. When fatigue is detected, the system triggers an alarm to alert the user, helping prevent accidents.
